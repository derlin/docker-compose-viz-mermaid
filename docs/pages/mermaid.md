[Mermaid JS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) is *a Javascript based diagramming
and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify
diagrams dynamically*. The syntax is easy and clear, and the output usually beautiful.

## Integrations

{{ page.title }} is supported out-of-the-box by many applications, including:

* Jetbrains IDEs (IntelliJ, etc.) through the built-in Markdown Plugin (see [diagrams](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/markdown.html#diagrams));
* Visual Studio code;
* [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/) renders mermaid diagrams in and md file;
* [typora](https://typora.io/);
* ...

See [mermaid-js#integrations](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/integrations?id=integrations) for a full list.

**GitHub** does not support it for now, but there are many browser extensions available
that will automatically detect and render the diagrams in md files.
I personally use [mermaid-extension](https://github.com/Stefan-S/mermaid-extension).
