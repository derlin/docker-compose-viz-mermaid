[Mermaid JS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) is *a Javascript based diagramming
and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify
diagrams dynamically*. The syntax is easy and clear, and the output usually beautiful.

## Support


{{ page.title }} is supported out-of-the-box in many markdown tools, including:

* Jetbrains IDEs (IntelliJ, etc.) through the Markdown Plugin (see [diagrams](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/markdown.html#diagrams));
* Visual Studio code;
* [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/) renders mermaid diagrams in and md file;
* [typora](https://typora.io/);
* ...

**GitHub** does not support it for now, but there are many browser extensions available
that will automatically detect and render the diagrams in md files.
I personally use [mermaid-extension](https://github.com/Stefan-S/mermaid-extension).


## Online tools

There are many tools online, most of which are actually used by {{ site.title }} under the hood.
The most useful is the online editor, where you can copy-paste and diagram and preview,
generate png or svg, etc.
